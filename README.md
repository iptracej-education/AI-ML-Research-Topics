# 🔬 Research Portfolio: Advanced Vulnerability Analysis Platforms

This repository summarizes my research interests at the intersection of **AI-powered code analysis**, **security engineering**, and **automated vulnerability discovery**. My work integrates Large Language Models (LLMs), fuzzing, symbolic execution, and human-in-the-loop collaboration to explore scalable, adaptive, and intelligent vulnerability analysis platforms.

## 📌 Research Themes

### 1. 🤝 Synergistic Human-Machine Collaboration in Vulnerability Research

Building hybrid analysis platforms that combine the reasoning power of LLMs with expert human intuition:

- **LLM-Augmented Research**: Leveraging LLMs (e.g., o3) to reason about complex vulnerabilities such as use-after-free bugs involving concurrency and shared state.
- **Human Oversight**: Mitigating LLM false positives (e.g., ~1:50 signal-to-noise ratio) through expert review and manual curation.
- **Iterative Learning Loops**: Enabling mutual improvement between human researchers and LLMs through collaborative debugging and continuous knowledge accumulation.

### 2. 🧠 LLM-Enhanced Deep Code Reasoning and Multi-Path Vulnerability Exploration

Using LLMs to break through the limitations of traditional single-path symbolic execution:

- **Beyond Crash Paths**: Exploring alternative branches and variable transitions that static tools typically ignore.
- **Guided Input Mutation**: Suggesting precise test inputs to trigger deeper and more complex code paths.
- **Concurrency and Shared Object Reasoning**: Automating analysis of vulnerabilities dependent on multi-threaded logic and dynamic object sharing.

### 3. 🔁 Adaptive and Data-Driven Vulnerability Discovery Pipelines

Designing systems that continuously refine and optimize vulnerability detection and exploit generation:

- **Feedback-Oriented Pipelines**: Orchestrating fuzzing, CodeQL analysis, and LLM suggestions in intelligent refinement loops.
- **Exploit Formula Optimization**: Prioritizing low-complexity exploit paths using taint analysis and instruction complexity classification.
- **Scalable Context Engineering**: Mitigating LLM limitations via smart context generation, static pre-filtering, and memory layout side-effect analysis.
